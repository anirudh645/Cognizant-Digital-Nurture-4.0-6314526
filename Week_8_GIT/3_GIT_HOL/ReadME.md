<h1>Creating a New Branch, Merging and Deleting it</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In this exercise I have created a new branch added a new file to it and visualized the difference with the help of p4merge</p>
<p>Then i have merged and deleted the branch</p>
<p>This is the remote where you can see the final updated branch with all the contents merged</p>
